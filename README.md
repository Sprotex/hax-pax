## How to setup toolchain

1. First, get a working arm-gnu-toolchain. Recommended option is to get it from [here](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads).
    - For example, on 64-bit Ubuntu, look for `x86_64 Linux hosted cross toolchains, AArch32 bare-metal target (arm-none-eabi)`
2. Follow linking instructions in [this response](https://askubuntu.com/a/1243405).
